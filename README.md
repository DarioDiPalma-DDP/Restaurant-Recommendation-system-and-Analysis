An University Project with @markserver using Spark and MLlib - Big Data

Various data analysis tasks on the “Restaurants and Consumers” dataset by UCI ML.<br/>
Tasks range from simple statistical analysis to business-economical analysis.<br/>

The final task implies the use of ML to create a recommendation engine with the
Collaborative Filtering algorithm.<br/>

3. Supply and demand analysis for each kind of cuisine.
4. Analysis on the ratings.
